# Three_Phase_Controlled_Rectifier
Three-phase controlled rectifier using six thyristors is designed here. We're targeting a specific load – a 400Ω resistor – while maintaining a steady load current of 1.7A.  To validate our design before actual implementation, we're simulating it using MATLAB and planning PCB layouts and Arduino Nano is used to generate gate pulse
